# About this manual

Rob, Liz Dinsdale, Tom Jeffries, Bruno Gomez-Gil, and several other colleagues and friends have been teaching genomics and metagenomics for a long time. They have written this manual over the course of several years, and in a variety of formats. Rob moved it to markdown using GitHub in Fall 2018 as part of his computational genomics class.
